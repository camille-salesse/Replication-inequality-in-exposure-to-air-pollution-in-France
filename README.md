# Replication-inequality-in-exposure-to-air-pollution-in-France

- These files contain all the codes and data needed to replicate the results of the paper "inequality in exposure to air pollution in France: bringing pollutant cocktail into the picture" salesse, 2023.
- To directly replicate the results and graphs : The final database and codes are in the "Replication econometrics and graph" folder.


# Comments 
- All the the codes and some initial pre-work databases (if the file size is not too large, github limits the size of the file to be uploaded) used to build the final database can be found in the other folders. The path names in the codes correspond to the folder names in this repository. The post-work data are available and merged to obtain the final database (see the "preparation" code).
- the shapefile used in the spatial analysis is too large to be downloaded here. it is possible, however, to download it directly here : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/decoupage-administratif-communal-francais-issu-d-openstreetmap/
- For reasons of confidentiality, the source data on the concentration of pollutants produced by ineris is not available in this file. However, the pollution indicators used in the study and the code to create it are available.
- the "merge of municipality" folder contains the codes and the final table for linking pre-merger and post-merger municipalities.
